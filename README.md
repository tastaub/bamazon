## Supervisor Mode

User is given two prompt options, display a table of departments or create a new department.

The display table shows department name, department cost, sales, and profit.

Department Cost is generated and updated based on the item cost times the quanity of items in that department. This field changes after items are added by a manager or purchased by a customer. The sales field is updated after customer purchases. Total profit is the difference between these two fields and is not included in the department table.
